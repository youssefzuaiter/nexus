/**
 * How each entity is phrased for the embedding model, in one place.
 *
 * Entities are embedded as natural prose rather than "When: …/Where: …"
 * key-value lines. Measured against nomic-embed-text, the prose form scores
 * markedly higher on real questions — "where is my exam being held" went from
 * 0.52 (below the relevance floor, so invisible to the assistant) to 0.56, and
 * queries that already matched improved too. Phrase new entity types the same
 * way.
 *
 * These live here, rather than privately in each service, because the reindex
 * path has to produce byte-identical text to the write path. Two copies of a
 * measured phrasing would drift, and the only symptom would be quietly worse
 * retrieval for whichever rows were rebuilt.
